# Tony Aggression Scripts

- To be created and updated.
- So far, aggression is increased each time Tony is alerted that he sees the player. In addition, it increases more as the player stays in his vision pyramid.
- Aggression starts at 40. Meant to be out of 100.
- Speed is meant to be equal to aggression/10. Increasing has a lot of variety for each possible object and event. Need to update Tony script for this.
- Hearing sound events with SoundListener script increases by 5. Will be changed to increase by sound level.
